### Implementing upward samples

Write a stand-alone JS program following these rules:

 1. Put the description you want to show up on the web page in triple-slash comments. Markdown is supported.

 1. Put the code you want to show up on the web page inside `//===START` and `//===END` delimiters.

 1. Return (export default) a DOM node.

Next, add the sample to `main.js` in the obvious way.
