### Testing

Upward uses its own testing framework, with chai assertions.
See any file in the `tests` directory for examples.
To run tests, open `tests/index.html`, or run `npm test`.

### Formatting

Standard JS formatting, with the exceptions that:

* Short if and for blocks may be placed on one line for compactness.
* Use of spaces to align analogous code structures on adjacent lines is encouraged.
